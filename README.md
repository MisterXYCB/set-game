# Set

This is a digital adaptation of the card game "Set". The game consists of a deck of 81 unique cards, each with four features: color, shape, number, and shading. The goal is to find sets of three cards where each feature is either all the same or all different.  

## Game modes:
- Time challenge: Find as many sets as possible within a given time limit.
- Infinite mode: Play without a time limit, focusing on finding sets at your own pace.
- Challenge mode: Find all sets in a given layout. (WIP, not yet implemented)

## How to play:
1. Start the game and select a mode.
2. Cards will be displayed on the screen.
3. Click on three cards that form a set.
4. If the selected cards form a valid set, they will be removed from the board, and new cards will be added.
5. If the selected cards do not form a set, they will remain on the board.


## Features:
- Leaderboard
- seeded runs
- auto-detection of sets: re-deal 9 cards if the 9 cards on the board do not contain a set
